If you are not familiar with the FNF files then make sure to check where everything is in the files!! Keep this in mind just incase a file gets misplaced when installing the mod.

To Install the mod, drag and drop the assets folder in Girlfriend Mode, to the assets folder in Friday Night Funkin'.

If this did not work, check and make sure there are no extra files where there shouldn't be, if there are then check where they're supposed to be and drag them there.

If that did not work, then contact me for support! I promise i'm here to help you, as this may be complicated at times. Be sure to check back on the page for my response!

have fun with the mod yo!
